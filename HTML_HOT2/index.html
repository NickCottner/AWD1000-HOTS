            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>
                We are a subcontractor that works on video games 
                with main developer companies like bungie, activision, ea, etc.
                Our whole staff loves what bungie puts out as a company, 
                so that's why we're named the same, just spelled differently.

            <h3>Our Products</h3>
            <p>
                We have worked on so many products that the main companies bring us in on. The most notable products,
                are the Halo series, Destiny series, Need for Speed series, and Call of Duty series.

            <h3>Our Team</h3>
            <p>
                We have over 100 employees working for us. We have two empolyees running the show.
                Our CEO is MasterChief, and our CFO is Cayde. 
                These two employees keep this company running, 
                and also benefit from the work the people below them do. You can almost say that the 98 other employees
                keep the productivity coming, and the head honchos get all the money.
